Sales Performance Analysis is an effective method to determine the sales progress over a period of time. The analysis allows us or sales team to identify the weak areas and what actions should be taken to improve the business performance over the period. It also provides several significant advantages to businesses and this includes identifying areas of improvement, tracking progress and profitable product line.  

I analyzed this Adidas Sales dataset in csv format which I acquired from Kaggle website and conducted a Sales Performance Analysis to provide insights on this following business questions:
•	How is the company’s overall performance?  
•	What are the most profitable retailer for adidas?  
•	Which customers are the most valuable to the company?  
•	What region experienced the highest sales over the period?  
•	Which type of shopping method is more popular among the buyers?
